# TGS (TerminalGPT Shell)

![TGS Logo](path_to_logo.png) <!-- If you have a logo, you can link it here -->

TGS is a revolutionary conversational shell that combines the power of Rust with the intelligence of GPT-based natural language processing. Designed as a spinoff of the TerminalGPT project, TGS aims to redefine the way users interact with their terminals.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Interact with your terminal in natural language. Instead of remembering complex commands, just tell TGS what you want to do.
- **Rust Integration**: Built with the robustness and efficiency of Rust, ensuring a fast and reliable terminal experience.
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: TGS provides smart suggestions and corrections, making your terminal experience smoother and more intuitive.
- **Safety Measures**: TGS has built-in safety checks to prevent accidental execution of potentially harmful commands.

## Installation

```bash
# Placeholder for installation commands
git clone <repository_link>
cd tgs
./install.sh
```

## Usage

Start TGS with the following command:

```bash
tgs
```

Once inside TGS, you can start conversing with your terminal:

```
tgs> Create a new directory called "projects"
Directory "projects" created.

tgs> List all files in the current directory
...output...
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests for TGS:

```bash
cargo test
```
